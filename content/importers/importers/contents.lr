body:

Tuesmon importers are designed for easy the migration of data from others
platforms, and try to keep as much data as possible (including history and
comments, when it is available), to ensure you don't miss anything when you
bring your project into Tuesmon.

Currently we have 4 importers:

  * [Trello](/importers/trello-importer)
  * [Jira 7](/importers/jira-importer)
  * [Github](/importers/github-importer)
  * [Asana](/importers/asana-importer)
