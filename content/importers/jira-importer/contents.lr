### What I need to import from Jira?

1. You need to configure in your Jira the access from Tuesmon that allows you to
give access with the rights of your users. To do this, you have to go to the
applications settings in your Jira server.

    ![New project creation](cert-step1.png "New project creation")

2. Then, select "Application links" configuration.

    ![New project creation](cert-step2.png "New project creation")

3. And create a new application link that points to "https://manage.tuesmon.com" (or
your tuesmon instance url).

    ![New project creation](cert-step3.png "New project creation")

4. You may be asked to confirm the url in some cases, you simply have to
confirm the url.

5. Then, you have to create the new application link called "Tuesmon" as a
"Generic Application" type, and check the "Create incomming link".

6. In the incomming link configuration, you have to set the consumer key to
"tuesmon", the consumer name to "Tuesmon", and in the public key you have to copy
and paste the text below:

    <pre class="white">-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA6HMNth/OevwEmvUJb2wP

you can import projects from this Jira instance.
