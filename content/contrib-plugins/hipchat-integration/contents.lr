*HipChat: Bring your team to life.*

First things first, [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com) is a huge platform with lots of features. Integration will always take time so please be patient. If you need a specific integration and you feel ready to get out your machete and start cutting into the tuesmon, please review our [API Docs](http://tuesmoncom.github.io/tuesmon-doc/dist/api.html).

If you need help with a specific feature, you can always get in touch with our community through our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tuesmoncom)
