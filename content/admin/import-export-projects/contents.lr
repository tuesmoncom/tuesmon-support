Tuesmon import/export feature allow you to extract all your data from one Tuesmon instance and move it to another one keeping.


Exporting a project
-------------------

To export a project and download the "dump file" you have to:

- Log into Tuesmon.
- Open the Project you wish to export.
- Click the "Admin" menu icon.  
  ![Admin button](import-export-screenshot-1.png "Admin button")
- In the center menu pane, click the option "Project Profile" > "Export."
- On the right-side of the screen, click the green "Export" button.  
  ![Export button](import-export-screenshot-2.png "Export button")
    - If you are using "manage.tuesmon.com" or an asynchronously configured Tuesmon instance the export (dump) file will be generated by the server in asynchronous mode and you will receive an email once the export file has been generated.  
      ![Asynchronous export result](import-export-screenshot-3.png "Asynchronous export result")  
      ![Export email](import-export-screenshot-4.png "Export email")  
    - If you are exporting from a local instance (or non-Tuesmon hosted) which is configured to work synchronously, you will see this screen. The JSON file should be downloaded automatically, and if not, you can always click the "here" in the link below.  
      ![Synchronous export result](import-export-screenshot-5.png "Synchronous export result")
- Your Tuesmon JSON file looks something like this (if you decide to poke around—please don’t!):  
  ![Dump content](import-export-screenshot-6.png "Dump content")


Importing a project
-------------------

!! The project import in tuesmon doesn't migrate users, only project data, if you want to keep the users relation with the project correctly, you have to create the users before you import the project. Important, the matching of users with the import data will be done through case-sensitive email addresses.

!!! If the import fails, please contact with support@tuesmon.com or ask through the Tuesmon Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tuesmoncom
Once you have a dump of your project, you can import it in other tuesmon instance.

- In your web browser, sign into the Tuesmon instance you wish to import the project into.
- On the main projects screen, click the "Upload" button to the right of "New Project." The button looks like an up-arrow with a line underneath it.  
  ![Import project button](import-export-screenshot-7.png "Import project button")
- Depending on your instance (manage.tuesmon.com or an asynchronously configured Tuesmon instance), you might get a screen that looks like this:  
  ![Importing project](import-export-screenshot-8.png "Importing project")
- Click "Accept" and wait for the email similar to the example below:  
  ![Import email](import-export-screenshot-8.png "Import email")
- Most likely, the import process will succeed and you will see the project appear on the main projects screen:  
  ![Projects list](import-export-screenshot-9.png "Projects list")
- Open the project and plan/develop/succeed as you did before!
