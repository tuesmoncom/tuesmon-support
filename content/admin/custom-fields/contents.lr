body:

Tuesmon includes optional custom fields in its administration panel. It will provide teams with a flexible input to fit in their workflow.

Users with administration permissions will be able to create new custom fields for their project User Stories, Tasks and Issues


### 1. Configure Custom Fields

1. Go to one of your Tuesmon projects.
2. Click on *admin* button. _In this example we will focus on User Stories, but this feature is also available on tasks and issues and same steps should be followed to edit them._
3. Go to *Attributes > US* and scroll down to the custom fields configuration.
4. Fill the name and description of your custom field. Remember your custom field needs a context for other users to understand it correctly.
