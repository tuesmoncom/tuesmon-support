title: GitHub Integration
---
body:

*GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 17.5 million repositories. These repositories are open to the community for public projects and secure for private ones.*


### What can we do currently?

Right now you can connect to a GitHub repository with a Tuesmon project and generate a one-way communication (from GitHub to Tuesmon) to:

- *Change the status of an epic, user story, issue, or task in Tuesmon with the commit message*: you may want to read more about this feature in the article ["Changing elements status via commit message"](/integrations/changing-elements-status-via-commit-message/ "Changing elements status via commit message").
- *Attach commits in an epic, user story, issue, or task of Tuesmon with the commit message*: you may want to read more about this feature in the article ["Attach commits to elements via commit message"](/integrations/attach-commits-to-elements-via-commit-message/ "Attach commits to elements via commit message").
- *Create issues* on Tuesmon when they are created on GitHub*.
- *Add comments to the connected issues on Tuesmon when they are created on GitHub*.

In Tuesmon an issue is connected with a GitHub issue if it was created by the GitHub integration. In the detail page of an issue on Tuesmon you can see a link under the subject to the original issue in GitHub.


### And what can't we do?

- *Dual synchronization*: currently the integration functionality only allows receiving messages from GitHub. Tuesmon can't communicate with GitHub (the one-way communication is from Github to Tuesmon), so changes made in Tuesmon won't be reflected in GitHub.
- *Show commit links in Tuesmon issues*: If you name a story, task or issue in a commit message (by its reference number) a link to commit won't appear in Tuesmon.
- "Sync current GitHub issues and comment when the integration module in Tuesmon is enabled*: the integration only works with the future issues and comments added in GitHub.

!! Integration will always take time so please be patient. If you need a specific integration and you feel ready to get a machete and get into the Tuesmon, please review our [API Docs](http://tuesmoncom.github.io/tuesmon-doc/dist/api.html) and our FAQs about [how you can contribute to Tuesmon](/frequently-asked-questions/how-can-i-contribute-to-tuesmon/#propose-some-feature-or-enhancement "How you can contribute?").

If you need help in a specific feature, you can always get in touch with the community and [contact with us](/frequently-asked-questions/how-can-i-contribute-to-tuesmon/#sent-us-your-feedback-or-questions "How you contact with us?").

### First: Configure the integration module in Tuesmon

1. Go to *Admin > Integrations > GitHub*
2. Fill *secret key* or use the auto generated one
2. Copy the *payload URL* input

### Second: Configure Webhooks in your GitHub repository

!!! Be careful if you use *organization webhooks* instead of *repository webhooks* because the first emit calls for events in all of the repositories and the second only in one of them.

1. Click on *Settings > Webhooks & Services > Add webhook*
2. On that screen set the *payload url* with the *payload url* from Tuesmon
3. The *secret key* must be filled with the same content as the *secret key* from Tuesmon
4. Content type must be *application/json*.
5. Tuesmon currently listens for three different kind of *events*. Just check *"send me everything"* or the events you want Tuesmon to listen for.
      1. *Push events*: changing element status via commit message
      2. *Issues*: issues created in GitHub appear automatically in Tuesmon
      3. *Issue comment*: issue comments created in GitHub appear automatically in Tuesmon
6. Press *Add webhook* button to create the new webhook
