title: Attach commits to elements via commit message
---
body:

You can mention any epic, user story, task or issue via commit message to show a commit link in the history panel.


### How?

Just add to your commit message something like:

```
TG-REF
```
- **REF**: US/Issue/Task reference of the element you want to modify


### An example, please!

```
Fix Issue TG-123
```
In this example, *123* is an issue reference.
